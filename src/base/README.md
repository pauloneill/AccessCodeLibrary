# Base

Originally, VB/VBA did not have an Assert method (now they have Debug.Assert)
But I wanted something more extensive and so I wrote this Assertion class based on [Design by Contract&trade;](https://www.eiffel.org/doc/eiffel/ET-_Design_by_Contract_%28tm%29%2C_Assertions_and_Exceptions), part of the [Eiffel programming language](https://www.eiffel.org/)

These classes provides a basic Assert with additional parameters as well as Pre- and Post-conditions.
It also supports other assertion handlers so you could, for example, write your assertions to a log file, a database or even a web service.

## Getting Started

Import all the classes into your project and then copy the contents of Global.bas into your project and now you have a global Assert object. It's that simple!

### Prerequisites

*(none)*
<!--
### Installing

Import the classes into your project, and either import the `Global` module or copy the contents into your own global module. <br />
That's it!

## Components - Index

### Modules

[Globals.bas](#Globals)

### Classes

[CAssert.cls](#CAssert)<br />
[cAssertHandler.cls](#cAssertHandler)<br />
[cSilentAssertionHandler.cls](#cSilentAssertionHandler)

## Components

### Globals
Source: ./Globals.bas

Copy the code from this module into your Global module (or use it as is) to instantiate an Assert object into your project.

#### Usage

`Public Assert As New CAssert`

#### Limitations/Caveats

By default, the cAssert class instantiates a default handler of `cAssertHandler` class.<br />
This class is specific to Access VBA and will display a message if the user is running an uncompiled database.

You can write your won custom assertion handlers by copying the [cSilentAssertionHandler](#cSilentAssertHandler) and modifying it to suit your needs.

## Classes

### cAssert
Source: ./cAssert.cls

#### Properties

`assertionQuit` (Read-only Property) - tells the caller to quit the program<br />
`assertionStop` (Read-only Property) - tells the caller to stop in the code<br />
`assertionContinue` (Read-only Property) - tells the caller to continue code execution

#### Methods

`addHandler(cAssertHandler)` - adds an Assertion Handler<br />
`removeHandler(cAssertHandler)` - removes an Assertion Handler<br />
`Assert(Condition, message [, Location])` - raises an assertion if the Condition is NOT True<br />
`Precondition(Condition, message [, Location])` - a special kind of Assertion (refer to [Design by Contract&trade;](https://www.eiffel.org/doc/eiffel/ET-_Design_by_Contract_%28tm%29%2C_Assertions_and_Exceptions))<br />
`PostCondition(Condition, message [, Location])` - a special kind of Assertion (refer to [Design by Contract&trade;](https://www.eiffel.org/doc/eiffel/ET-_Design_by_Contract_%28tm%29%2C_Assertions_and_Exceptions))

#### Usage

`Public Assert As New CAssert`

#### Limitations/Caveats

### cAssertHandler
Source: ./cAssertHandler.cls

#### Properties

*(none)*

#### Methods

handleAssertion(ByVal message As String) - returns an assertion response type

#### Usage

`Dim ahThis as New cAssertHandler`<br />
`Assert.AddHandler ahThis`<br />
`ahThis.handleAssertion(Your message goes here")` - this is called automagically by the `Assert` methods


#### Limitations/Caveats


### cSilentAssertionHandler
Source: ./cSilentAssertionHandler.cls

#### Properties

`count()` (Read-only property)<br />
`assertions()` (Read-only property)

#### Methods

`reset()` - clears out any unprocessed assertion messages

#### Usage


#### Limitations/Caveats


### cBusyPointer
Source: ./cBusyPointer.cls

#### Properties

_(none)_

#### Methods

`Show` - Displays a busy pointer in place of the default mouse pointer.

#### Usage

`Dim hourGlass As New cBusyPointer`<br />
`hourGlass.Show`

When your object goes out of scope, the Terminate() method will automatically restore your mouse pointer (so you really want to declare this where the work happens)

#### Limitations/Caveats

Due to the way VB/VBA instantiates objects, simply declaring `hourGlass As New cBusyPointer` does nothing.

Instead you need to include an `hourGlass.Show` statement before the busy pointer will appear
e.g. `Dim busyPointer As New cHourglass` doesn't do anything until you do `busyPointer.Show`
